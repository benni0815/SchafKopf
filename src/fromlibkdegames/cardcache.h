/**
 * \class KCardCache cardcache.h <KCardCache>
 * 
 * This class implements a kdegames wide cache for cards.
 * 
 * Card games such as lskat or kpat should use this cache
 * to load the various decks into QPixmaps instead of inventing
 * their own. It uses KPixmapCache behind the scenes, set up to
 * use disk and memory caching. Thus a SVG card deck that was loaded 
 * by kpat for the size 100x200 doesn't need re-rendering when 
 * requested from lskat.
 * 
 * Usage is quite simple. During initialization of the game the
 * cache object should be created and it should be told to load the
 * currently selected theme.
 * <code>
 * myCache = new KCardCache();
 * myCache->loadTheme( myTheme );
 * </code>
 * 
 * Later when actually drawing the cards the getter methods can be used to 
 * get the pixmap of a specific card at a specific size from a given theme.
 * <code>
 * myCache->getCard( myTheme, KCardCache::Club, KCardCache::Ace, calculatedSize );
 * </code>
